## Description



## Getting Started

<!-- - This library is listed in the official [Arduino Library Manager](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/datatome/).
- _**—Recommended Platform—**_ Use the [PlatformIO Registry](https://registry.platformio.org/libraries/robotieee/competitive_collection) to install the library!
- You can see the source code at the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/robotieee/competitive_collection).
- To avoid duplicating data for smaller samples of the same data, _[check the Partials feature](https://alexandrehiroyuki.github.io/DataTomeDocs/docs/category/partials)_! -->

## Documentation

<!-- This library calculates statistical functions using a time-series sample implemented with a circular array that improves the performance.
